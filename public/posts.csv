2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Farewell Minecraft|<p>As a hot topic I'd like to add my own thoughts about Microsoft buying Mojang.</p><p>I am not a huge fan of Minecraft like the crazy guys building 4bit computers but I do enjoy playing with it for a couple of years now.</p><p>I am also not a Microsoft hater - since I used Windows and other products for so many years - but I have to say they are pretty good at screw up games. (Age of Empires online, or the new app-clashoftitans-clone thingie).</p><p>The core team leaving Minecraft can end in two ways. Like have some fresh minds in the team might change the game.</p><p>The real problem is how Microsoft handle developments. And probably I don't want to see microtrans-actions in the game or, stupid facebook share as founding a diamond.</p><p>Maybe I am wrong and we will have never seen awesomeness in the game. But I am afraid that will be the end of an era for me...</p>
2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|My opinion about online code schools|<p>I believe no matter how good you are you can always learn something new so I try to find a useful online coding school.</p><p>I am interested in front-end courses of course and Ruby or PHP courses maybe some NoSQL. And since I already work as a dev I'd like to spend the money for real learning. <br>Badges are cool and I like nice design elements but absolutely not mandatory. Don't pay the 10 designer to draw little frogs (treehouse...) pay instead real teachers. (When I cancelled my subscription from CodeSchool I've got an email with a nicely designed animated car leaving... seriously...)</p><p>Ok so I got my budget for it and I know what I want but what is next?</p><p>I tried <a href="http://codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a> for 2 months (one month last year and one just now because I have 2*$5 discount)</p><p>At the first time I really liked it then I lost in the stupid songs. Got board that the actual tasks are only accept one solution (sometimes I don't agree with them) <br>So I have to use the hints to actually write the same stuff as they did just in a different format. <br>However there were a few really good course like the mastering git or try ruby.</p><p>My conclusion is that they put too much effort designing stuff. Their free courses are good but the paid ones are boring after a while. ($29/month)</p><p>Years ago I planned to sign up for <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Tree House</a> but somehow I cannot handle the frogie thing and the hipsters on the front page learning in the park with a tablet. I wanted to try the trial but I don't understand why it they require my bankcard for that so no thank you. ($25 or $49/month)</p><p>Then we have <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a> what is free and I just earned a badge actually click on the start button how cool I am :) <br>I playing the Ruby lesson and we are assigning numbers and strings for freaking 5 steps now but the advanced courses are very nice. I'll give a longer chance for it. (free)</p><p>Last one for front-end coders is <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">Frontend Masters</a>. I've read really positive reviews and the teachers are guys your really want to learn from. I don't like the price ($39/month). I can imagine that I pay by course. I'll give a shot probably in this year.</p><p>Online courses like CMS they want to be good for everyone but then focus on quantity rather then quality, or feeding the designers :) <br>I will write again about this topic when I tested the others as well.</p>
2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Nordic.js 0day|<p>Let's change to blog's title to developer's tale because I will spice this post with some personal thoughts but it is always good to have a little bit of me in between the nerd things :)</p><p>So my flight took off from Oslo at 7pm and we landed at 7:40 in Stockholm (damn I nearly drank my beer) at Arlanda airport. The first ticket machine was the buss' I was looking for (119 SEK) what took me nearly in front of the hotel door, what is a hostel with lots of youngsters running in pyjamas, but extra clean and quite and nice and everyone is smiling. <br>I forget how "fun" is the shared bathroom but actually after an hour wait I could finally have a shower.</p><p>The best of these travels when you buy some boxed food from the store and it out from it using the bread as a fork :) I love it.</p><p>We'll have an early start tomorrow because the boat will leave at 8am but I need to get my wristband.

2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Build your own grid #1|<p><em>This is an episode of my "<strong><a href="http://microtroll.github.io/rocks">You might not need framework</a></strong>" series</em></p><p>Do you know how easy to write a CSS grid system? Do you know it is just simple math?</p><p>People are afraid of touching css so they use bootstrap or foundation or something else, then start to overwrite the framework to fit into their project. Like I did several times. I was thinking hey why am I doing this? I wrote my first CSS in the 90's and still as first thing I reach for one of the well known (and just to make it clear really amazing) frameworks.</p><p>So I start to think and read then write my own grid. It took like 20 minutes or less. I spend some time on thinking how to name things.</p><p>Let's do the math. First we have the container. I preferred to keep it unset, only thing I did just call it <strong>grid</strong>. Bootstrap set it to 1170px wide but I want to set my own. <br>Next are the rows. 1 row is 1 full unit, that is 100%.<br>(You have set the grid to 1170px then that is you full unit that is your 100%). I called them <strong>lines</strong> but it can be easily renamed since it is my own CSS so I don't need to dig in the code.</p><p>Ok we have the container and we have the rows or lines. <br>In a row/line you can have max 12 units if you use a 12 grid system</p><p><em>There are 16 or 24 as well, but hey what if you want to have a 32 system, right?</em></p><p>I called unit <strong>u-X-Y</strong>. U stands for unit of course, X if the amount of Y. For example you want third of the row/line than you will add <code>&lt;div class="u-1-3"/&gt;</code> because you want to get a unit as 1/3 of 100%. <br>If you put 3 of them together then you will get a full row/line.</p><p>But how the hell are they stick together? Well we have float and clear.</p><p>Because of the box modelling you have to set up some global rules</p><pre><code class="css">*, *:after, *:before {<br>  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>  box-sizing: border-box;<br>}<br></code></pre><p>Set the container and the rows/lines</p><pre><code class="css">.grid {<br>  margin-right: auto;<br>  margin-left: auto;<br>  padding-right: 15px;<br>  padding-left: 15px;<br>}<br><br>.line {<br>  width: 100%;<br>}<br><br>.line:after {<br>  content: "";<br>  display: table;<br>  clear: both;<br>}</code></pre><p>Then float all the units to the left and add padding as gutter but not to the last element.</p><pre><code class="css">[class*="u-"] {<br>  float: left;<br>  padding-right: 15px;<br>}<br><br>[class*="u-"]:last-of-type {<br>  padding-right: 0;<br>}</code></pre><p>And last you start calculating your units. I did it one by one then I realised that I will have same rules so I merged them but again, it is you CSS do whatever you have to.</p><pre><code class="css">.u-1-1 { width: 100%; }<br>.u-1-2 { width: 50%; }<br>.u-1-3 { width: 25%; }</code></pre><p>Got it? How about this:</p><p>Give me 1/1 of 100 = 100 <br>Give me 1/2 of 100 = 50 <br>Give me 1/3 of 100 = 25</p><p>When you go one by one you will see some of the unit make no sense like <strong>u-3-2</strong>. It will be 3/2 of 100 = 150% but you don't want to have bigger then your container.</p><p>You can find the source on <a href="https://github.com/microtroll/rocks">github</a>. At this point this is ONLY containing the grid itself. If you try to resize the window it will transform but not stacking. Let's keep that for the next episode.</p><p>PS: If you want you can use <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a> or write your own reset but I think finding the right amount of tools is important and I think normalize.css is one of THE tools I suggest to use. (Bootstrap, Foundation and PureCSS do)</p><p>I hope it helped a bit. Next time I will explain the stacking and the media queries.</p>
2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Build your own grid #2|<p><em>This is an episode of my "<strong><a href="http://microtroll.github.io/rocks">You might not need framework</a></strong>" series</em></p><p>Well last time we created the grid but it wasn't responsive at all. This time I added only a few simple trick using media queries (<a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/">Media Queries for Standard Devices</a>). <br>I also defined 3 stages, mobile, tablet and desktop so we can show and hide for the specific media.</p><pre><code class="css">/* For desktop */<br>@media (min-width: 992px) {<br>  .for-mobile,<br>  .for-tablet {<br>    display: none;<br>  }<br>}<br><br>/* For tablet */<br>@media (max-width: 991px) and (min-width: 769px) {<br>  .for-mobile,<br>  .for-desktop {<br>    display: none;<br>  }<br>}</code></pre><p>The real trick starts here I reset the floating and change very unit to be 100% so it will stack to each other and fill the full with.</p><pre><code class="css">/* For mobile */<br>@media (max-width: 768px) {<br>  [class*="u-"] {<br>    float: none;<br>    width: 100%;<br>    padding-right: 0;<br>    margin-left: 0;<br>  }<br><br>  .for-tablet,<br>  .for-desktop {<br>    display: none;<br>  }<br>}</code></pre><p>We need offset as well. that will give as an empty unit. no trick here at all. Copy all the <strong>.u-X-Y</strong> then rename to <strong>.u-offset-X-Y</strong> or whatever you prefer. Then change width to margin-left. Keep the values. Job done! :)</p><pre><code class="css">.u-offset-1-2, .u-offset-2-4, .u-offset-3-6, .u-offset-4-8, .u-offset-5-10, .u-offset-6-12 { margin-left: 50%; }<br>.u-offset-1-3, .u-offset-2-6, .u-offset-3-9, .u-offset-4-12 { margin-left: 33.33333333%; }<br>.u-offset-1-4, .u-offset-2-8, .u-offset-3-12 { margin-left: 25%; }<br>.u-offset-1-5, .u-offset-2-10 { margin-left: 20%; }<br>.u-offset-1-6, .u-offset-2-12 { margin-left: 16.66666667%; }<br>.u-offset-1-7 { margin-left: 14.2857143%; }<br>.u-offset-1-8 { margin-left: 12.5%; }<br>.u-offset-1-9 { margin-left: 11.1111111%; }<br>.u-offset-1-10 { margin-left: 10%; }<br>.u-offset-1-11 { margin-left: 9.09090909%; }<br>.u-offset-1-12 { margin-left: 8.333333333%; }<br>.u-offset-2-3, .u-offset-4-6, .u-offset-6-9, .u-offset-8-12 { margin-left: 66.66666667%; }</code></pre><p>As always the source is on <a href="https://github.com/microtroll/rocks">GitHub</a></p><p>Next I will tame the forms.</p>
2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Build your own tooltip|<p><em>This is an episode of my "<strong><a href="http://microtroll.github.io/rocks">You might not need framework</a></strong>" series</em></p><p>I like tooltips, they look really nice but do we really need to have as a Javascript plugin?

2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Hello World|<p>Is it just me or more people actually lost the fun part because of the tools and framewroks? I did enjoy web development so much but today it is nothing else then get something with bower include it and use it with a oneliner. Basically 80% of the community has no idea what that thing does.<br>I did a lot of thinking and realised that might be the problem, I want to make stuff again so I start collection small but useful scripts, styles. Today I have the minimum to write my own blog page without using ANY tool or framework.<br>I did got some ideas and inspirations from other people, I also "stole" a few lines but I can proudly say that every single piece of this site is handmade by me and I want to keep this way.</p>
2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Best backend|<p>I was thinking a lot what should be the best backend for my blog then after a bit of investigation I found the answer. The easiest, the fastest and the best(?). Do you need JSON for you javascript? Then just create a spreadsheet in Google Drive and publish to web and get the hashtag from the url and insert into this url: <pre><code>https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/{{ HASH }}/od6/public/basic?hl=en_US&amp;alt=json</code></pre> There you go, you have a fully working backend in 1 line :)</p>
2014-10-04T07:30:03.591Z|Huge cleanup|<p>Developer tales again :)</p><p>Being sick sometimes have good results. This weekend I wrote at least a few thousand lines of code started with cleanup my old projects. I found scripts I don't even know when did I wrote or I wrote it or someone else I just have it.</p><p>I have so many unfinished projects that I had to set up a few rules.<br><br>Is it something I enjoy doing?<br>Is it something fun or useful?<br>Is it just a bunch of framework tied together or a self project?</p><p>I deleted a lot, rewrite even more... I also got rid of a lot of CoffeeScript because I found the output really confusing now even I like to code in coffee. Then I removed any library or framework I could from projects.</p><p>Another big change that I set up my domain to use my github pages.</p>
2014-10-23T23:01:04.541Z|Jiffy v0.1.0 and others|<p>I think I am really bad with titles :)</p><p>As part of the cleanup I started to re-learn all I know and there are plenty of holes in my knowledge thanks to using a tool all the time.</p><p>In the last couple of weeks I read, learn and apply what I got. I have to say I feel more confident writing code than before.</p><p>(FYI as tools I meant tools are doing the just instead of you in your code not as tools like test or task runners)<br>I was obsessed with Karma (I still like it) but since I started using Mocha I don't understand why I haven't used it yet. So from now on I will stick with it.</p><p><b>Jiffy</b> is a date manipulator lib. I am a big fan of <a href="http://momentjs.com" target="_blank">moment.js</a> so I decided to write my own date handler mini library. <a href="http://github.com/microtroll/jiffy">Check it out.</a></p><p>PS: I also made a few changes on this site. Now I load the posts from a CSV file from github and I made a lot of cleanup.</p><pre><code>var csv2json = function(csv) {<br>  var ln = csv.split('\n');<br>  var result = [];<br>  var head = ln[0].split(',');<br><br>  for (var i = 1; i < ln.length; i++) {<br>    var obj = {};<br>    var cur = ln[i].split(',');<br><br>    for (var j = 0; j < head.length; j++) {<br>      obj[head[j]] = cur[j];<br>    }<br><br>    result.push(obj);<br>  }<br><br>  return result;<br>};</code></pre>
